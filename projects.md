### [Luminance HDR](https://github.com/LuminanceHDR/LuminanceHDR) 
Luminance HDR is an application to manage the complete workflow of a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image. I worked on the project between 2010 and 2014: under my leadership, the project was awarded the May 2012 Sourceforge Project of the Month and twice the Sourceforge Project of the Week.
