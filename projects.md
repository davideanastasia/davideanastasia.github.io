###Â [Short Circuit Audio](https://shortcircuitaudio.com/)
Short Circuit Audio is a website where I showcase some of my works in audio and guitar effects. Guitars have always been a passion of mine, so I decided to publish some of my designs and give them a chance to be used by a larger audience.

### [Luminance HDR](https://github.com/LuminanceHDR/LuminanceHDR) 
Luminance HDR is an application to manage the complete workflow of a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image. I worked on the project between 2010 and 2014: under my leadership, the project was awarded the May 2012 Sourceforge Project of the Month and twice the Sourceforge Project of the Week.
